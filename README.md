## Prototype Development for Image Captioning Using the BLIP Model and Gradio Framework

### AIM:
To design and deploy a prototype application for image captioning by utilizing the BLIP image-captioning model and integrating it with the Gradio UI framework for user interaction and evaluation.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The challenge is to create an interactive image captioning tool that uses a pretrained BLIP model to generate captions for images uploaded by users. The application should be able to receive an image, pass it through the BLIP model to generate captions, and then display the generated caption to the user in a user-friendly Gradio interface.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1:

Install required libraries like Gradio and BLIP.

Ensure the environment has access to the necessary model files.

#### STEP 2:

Load the BLIP model from a pretrained version available through libraries like transformers or another source.

Ensure that the BLIP model is correctly configured to accept image inputs and generate captions.

#### STEP 3:

Define a simple UI using Gradio, where users can upload an image.

The Gradio interface will display the caption generated by the BLIP model after processing the image.

### PROGRAM:

```
import os
import io
import IPython.display
from PIL import Image
import base64
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
import requests
import json
import gradio as gr

# Load environment variables from .env file
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

# Access environment variables
hf_api_key = "your_huggingface_api_key_here"
ENDPOINT_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/your-model-id"
PORT = int(os.environ.get('PORT1', 7860))  # Default to 7860 if PORT1 not set

# Function to call Hugging Face API for image captioning
def get_completion(inputs, parameters=None):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {hf_api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    data = {"inputs": inputs}
    if parameters:
        data["parameters"] = parameters
    response = requests.post(ENDPOINT_URL, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")

# Convert PIL image to base64 string
def image_to_base64_str(pil_image):
    byte_arr = io.BytesIO()
    pil_image.save(byte_arr, format="PNG")
    byte_arr = byte_arr.getvalue()
    return base64.b64encode(byte_arr).decode("utf-8")

# Generate wildlife caption from image
def wildlife_captioner(image):
    base64_image = image_to_base64_str(image)
    result = get_completion(base64_image)
    return result[0].get("generated_text", "No caption generated.")

# Display sample wildlife image (optional)
sample_image_url = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506744038136-46273834b3fb"  # Example wildlife image
IPython.display.display(IPython.display.Image(url=sample_image_url))

# Create Gradio interface for wildlife captions
gr.close_all()  # Ensure no previous Gradio instances are running

demo = gr.Interface(
    fn=wildlife_captioner,
    inputs=[gr.Image(label="Upload Wildlife Photo", type="pil")],
    outputs=[gr.Textbox(label="Generated Wildlife Caption")],
    title="Wildlife Photography Captioning",
    description="Upload wildlife photos and get natural, descriptive captions generated by a BLIP model.",
    allow_flagging="never",
    examples=[
        "examples/wildlife_lion.jpg",
        "examples/wildlife_eagle.jpg",
        "examples/wildlife_elephant.jpg",
    ],
)

# Launch app
demo.launch(share=True, server_port=PORT)
demo.close()

```

### OUTPUT:

![gen 6 th one](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e774ec9-56d0-4710-b897-82e714b8029e)

output:
A wounderful forest 

### RESULT:

The application allows users to upload an image through the Gradio interface, where it is processed by the BLIP model to generate a caption. Once the image is processed, the BLIP model produces a concise and relevant description of the image, which is displayed back to the user. For instance, if the uploaded image depicts a dog running in a park, the model may generate a caption such as "A dog running on grass." The system successfully demonstrates the integration of the BLIP image captioning model with Gradio, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for real-time caption generation. The prototype works effectively for a variety of images, offering accurate and contextually appropriate captions. This application could be expanded further to handle more complex use cases, such as captioning images from specific domains like medical, fashion, or sports.
